## One liner solutions / Ideas / Approaches

- Longest Increasing Subsequence : 
    Subsequence problem, thus skip/take element approach, we can skip an element only
    when it cannot be included in the current subsequence.
    After that, simple DP and memoization.

- Maximizing Profit by Job Scheduling
    DP with binary search after sorting the arrays based on startTime.
    DP from maximizing, binary search to figure out the next possible element in the sequence.
